### Definition of 'Webhook'

A webhook is a method of communication between two web applications, 
where one application sends data to a specific URL endpoint of another 
application in real time. It allows the sender application to trigger 
an HTTP request containing data or notifications to the receiver 
application. The receiver application can then process the data and 
perform actions based on the received information. 
Webhooks are commonly used for event-driven scenarios, 
data synchronization, and automation and integration purposes.
